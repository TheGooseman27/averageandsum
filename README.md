So, I've tried to get the GUI part to work, and even made a mockup in Word.
However, I was completely unable to get it to work properly in time.
So, I've simply submitted the program without the GUI section and I'm praying for the best.
Part of the reason I've been behind is that I got a new job, so I haven't had as much time to get work done.
I've at least finished up the functional part of the assignment, but I apologize for failing to finish the GUI.
